# WHAPI vs Terminal-Based WhatsApp Automation

## 🎯 Objective

Compare the feasibility and efficiency of using WHAPI (3rd party API) vs running WhatsApp automations via terminal-based scripts (e.g., Puppeteer or Vercept-style setups).

---

## 🧪 WHAPI (API Service)

- ✅ **No need for terminal / local runtime**
- ✅ Built-in authentication/session management
- ✅ Easy to plug into n8n or Make.com
- ❌ Subscription cost
- ❌ Message volume limits depending on tier

---

## 🖥 Terminal-based Automation

- ✅ Free after setup
- ✅ Fine-grained control over browser behavior
- ❌ Requires machine on 24/7 (electric + hardware strain)
- ❌ Risky (browser detection, WhatsApp bans)
- ❌ Setup fragility — selectors often break

---

## ✅ Recommendation

WHAPI is the **FabApproved™** solution
