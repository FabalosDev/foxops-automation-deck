# üìë Social Media Automation Policy

## 1. üß≠ Executive Summary

## Executive Summary

Social media automation boosts consistency, saves time, and helps scale engagement. But done wrong, it risks platform penalties like shadowbans, account locks, or even bans ‚Äî especially on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. This policy outlines a safe, compliant automation strategy tailored to our current tools and platforms.

**Key Highlights:**
- Platforms like Meta and TikTok are strict ‚Äî avoid auto-DMs, mass commenting, or spammy behavior.
- Use **approved tools** like Buffer, Make.com, and n8n with proper cooldowns and logic.
- **Hybrid approach recommended**: combine automation with manual approvals (e.g. Telegram alerts before posting).
- Always mimic human behavior ‚Äî avoid exact post times, robotic patterns, or bulk actions.
- Keep logs, audit trails, and fallback options to protect accounts.
- Avoid risky practices: auto-follow/unfollow, comment bots, API overuse.
- Use platform-native tools when available (Meta Business Suite, YouTube Studio).

**Bottom Line:**  
Automation should feel helpful ‚Äî not spammy. This policy helps us move fast *without breaking trust* or violating platform rules.

## 2. üìå Scope & Objectives

This policy defines acceptable and compliant automation practices across major social media platforms, with a focus on maintaining brand trust, avoiding account restrictions, and streamlining engagement workflows.

**Covered Platforms:**
- **Facebook & Instagram** ‚Äì Meta‚Äôs ecosystem; strict on spam, automated engagement, and fake behavior.
- **WhatsApp** ‚Äì Messaging automation allowed only via approved APIs (e.g. WhatsApp Business API); no bulk or unauthorized outreach.
- **LinkedIn** ‚Äì Professional network with limited tolerance for automation; scraping, auto-connect, or messaging bots often flagged.
- **TikTok** ‚Äì Highly restrictive; discourages any third-party automation or behavioral mimicry.
- **Pinterest** ‚Äì Scheduling allowed; botting or scraping not permitted.
- **X (formerly Twitter)** ‚Äì Allows automation if it follows API rules and doesn‚Äôt simulate unsolicited engagement.
- **Truth Social** ‚Äì Less documented, but still expected to comply with standard ethical automation (no spam or scraping).

**Objectives:**
- Define which automation practices are safe vs. risky per platform.
- Identify the tools and techniques allowed under platform policies.
- Help the team balance efficiency with compliance.
- Prevent account warnings, throttling, or bans due to unsafe automation.
- Encourage human-centric design even in automated workflows.

## 5. ü¶ä FabalosDev Recommendations
- Use hybrid systems (AI + manual fallback)
- Don‚Äôt go full auto unless platform allows it
- Document all automations
- Use storytelling tone, not spammy templates
- Treat engagement like conversation, not campaign blast
